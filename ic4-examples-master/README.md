## Download

To download all examples in a .zip file, click the green *Code* button and select *Download ZIP*.

You can also select *Open with Visual Studio* to clone the examples into a directory on your computer, or use git directly.

After downloading, please make sure to keep the per-language directory structure intact so that relative file references can work.

***Warning:*** Be careful when cloning/extracting to a directory with a long path name; many tools are still limited by Windows' legacy 260-character path length limit and can raise obscure error messages in case a file path exceeds it.

## Cameras and Drivers

All examples assume you have access to an industrial camera from [The Imaging Source](https://www.theimagingsource.com).

Make sure a [GenTL Producer](https://www.theimagingsource.com/en-us/support/download/) matching your camera is installed.
