             * GigEVision and USB3Vision devices can send asynchronous events to applications
             * This example shows how to receive events EventExposureEnd, which indicates that the camera has completed
             * the integration time and will start transmitting the image data.
             * 
             * This event is useful when synchronizing real-world activities with camera operation, for example moving
             * something while the image is being transmitted.
             * 
             * Events are configured and received through the device property map.
             * The following shows an excerpt from the device property map of a device supporting EventExposureEnd:
             * 
             * - EventControl
             *   - EventSelector
             *   - EventNotification[EventSelector]
             *   - EventExposureEndData
             *     - EventExposureEnd
             *     - EventExposureEndTimestamp
             *     - EventExposureEndFrameID
             *     
             * To receive notifications for a specific event, two steps have to be taken:
             * 
             * First, the device has to be configured to send generate the specific event. To enable the EventExposureEnd event, set the
             * "EventSelector" enumeration property to "EventExposureEnd", and then set the "EventNotification" enumeration property to "On".
             * 
             * Second, a property notification handler has to be registered for the property representing the event.
             * The EventExposureEnd is represented by the integer property "EventExposureEnd". This property has no function other
             * than being invalidated and thus having its notification raised when the device sends the event.
             * 
             * Event parameters are grouped with the event property in a property category with "Data" appended to the event's name,
             * in our case "EventExposureEndData". The category contains the integer properties "EventExposureEndTimestamp"
             * and "EventExposureEndFrameID", which provide the time stamp and frame ID of the event.
             * Event argument properties should only be read inside the event notification function to avoid data races.
